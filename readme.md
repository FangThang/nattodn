This repository is for the DIY build 'add-venture' Christopher and I will be completing over the next 6 to 12 months. It should consist of:

- The First Step Case
- Getting Power to the Case
- The First Module
- Building your first row
   - 10 or so modules potentially including
      - clocks
      - generative composition
      - VCO
      - VCA
      - VCF
      - Modulators
      - and more

The intent is to build everything we can from scratch, no kits. More than likely we'll run into situations where the only way is to purchase a kit, but, those should be the exception. So you'll learn alongside us the joys of sourcing components, constructing, calibrating and the heart ache of a failed build.

Don't worry if you don't know what some or all of this means at the moment. You will, assuming we don't abandon due to the vision of our turkey necked mortality being rejected by one of our egos.

If we decide to continue after the first row is complete (~104 hp of modules) we'll open a new repository/branch/project that will house the next part of the journey, whatever that turns out to be.

Love
